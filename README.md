#For both the MIPS and Java versions:

Simply compile/assemble whichever program version you want to use and then run the program. Both programs will generate their own tracefile full of random addresses so no additional tracefiles are needed. The programs will perform a simulation with the random addresses that were generated and then output the results of the simulation (including hit rate, latency, and cycles) to the console.
